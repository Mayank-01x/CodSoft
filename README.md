# 🛠️ **CodSoft C++ Programming Internship Repository**

Welcome to the **CodSoft C++ Programming Internship Repository**! This repository contains the projects I developed during my internship, focusing on practical programming tasks aimed at strengthening core C++ skills.

---

## 📜 **Overview**

As part of the internship, I am required to complete a minimum of three tasks. These tasks are designed to cover various aspects of C++ programming, including:

- 🧠 **Logic Building**
- ➕ **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
- 🎮 **Game Development**

The projects included in this repository are:

1. **Task 1**: 🎯 Number Guessing Game
2. **Task 2**: ➗ Simple Calculator
3. **Task 3**: ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## 🎯 **Task 1: Number Guessing Game**

**Objective**: Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

### 🔑 **Key Features:**
- 🎲 Generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- 📝 Prompt the user to guess the number.
- 📈 Provide feedback: "Too high" or "Too low".
- 🔄 Continue until the user guesses the correct number.
- 🏆 Display the number of attempts made.

## ➗ **Task 2: Simple Calculator**

**Objective**: Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 🔑 **Key Features:**
- 🔢 Allow the user to input two numbers.
- ➕➖✖️➗ Provide options for the user to choose an arithmetic operation.
- 🧮 Perform the selected operation and display the result.
- 🚫 Handle edge cases, such as division by zero.

## ❌⭕ **Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

**Objective**: Implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can play against each other on the console.

### 🔑 **Key Features:**
- 🗂️ **Game Board**: Create a 3x3 grid as the game board.
- 👥 **Players**: Assign "X" and "O" to two players.
- 📊 **Display Board**: Show the current state of the board after each move.
- 🎮 **Player Input**: Prompt the current player to enter their move (choose a cell on the grid).
- ✏️ **Update Board**: Update the game board with the player's move.
- 🏆 **Check for Win**: Check if the current player has won the game.
- 🤝 **Check for Draw**: Determine if the game ends in a draw (no more valid moves).
- 🔄 **Switch Players**: Alternate turns between "X" and "O" players.
- 🏁 **Display Result**: Show the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).
- 🔁 **Play Again**: Ask if the players want to play another game.
